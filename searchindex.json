After receiving the vaccine shooting, we are now confident to gather with our friends.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s very kind of Dr. Li to invite us to his family for Thanksgiving. I prepared a traditional Chinese food called La Rou (Chinese bacon meat), and my roommate Guolong brought a dish called Simmered Pig Feet.\nExcept for us students, Dr. Yang, Dr. Liang, Dr. Zhang, Dr. Genqiao, and their family members also gathered together in Dr. Li\u0026rsquo;s house. They also brought delicious food with them. Some photos were listed:\nAfter the delicious lunch, we chatted for a long time, talking about life, job, family, and so on. Then we played cards and had great fun using Bargaining Chip and White papers as money to play the\u0026quot;Zha Jin Hua\u0026quot; game. When we left, Dr. Li asked us to bring more food with us. Appreciate it!\nI forgot to take photos of these happy moments. But considering my father\u0026rsquo;s health situation, I probably will leave the U.S to find jobs in China next year. So it would be my last Thanksgiving in OSU.\nThis will definitely be my most memorable thanksgiving. Thanks, my dear advisor. Thanks, all my friends!\n","id":1,"section":"posts","summary":"The pandemic caused so many difficulties, and I have been trapped from gathering for a long time.
